/*Write a simple program that converts the temperature in Celsius scale to Fahrenheit scale and vice versa using
the basic concept of class and object. Make separate classes for Celsius and Fahrenheit which will have the private
members that hold the temperature value and make conversion functions in each class for conversion from one to another.
For example, you need to have a function toFahrenheit() in class Celsius that converts to Fahrenheit scale and returns
the value.*/
